# npm packages

## Version 2.1 - 01/09/2022

After migrating to GCP these are the installed npm packages:

* engines
    * "node": "18.8.0"
      * latest version at the time. Not doing anyting too crazy with node so latest version should generally work. Should be safe enough to apply updates. 
    * "npm": "8.18.0"
 * dependencies
    * "@google-cloud/logging-winston": "^5.1.4",
    * "@metaplex-foundation/js": "0.15.0",
    * "@solana/web3.js": "*",
    * "discord.js": "14.2.0",
    * "dotenv": "*",
    * "pg": "8.7.3",
    * "request": "2.81.0",
    * "winston": "^3.8.1"
