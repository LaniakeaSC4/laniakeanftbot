# How to setup

1. Invite with https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=996170261353222219&permissions=2064&scope=bot%20applications.commands
2. Let me know the bot is in server and wait for confirmation to move to step 3.
3. In a channel the bot has send permissions in, type /setup. If you don't see the setup command, restart/refresh your discord app.
4. Click 'Let's Go' to set up the bot channels. You can rename these and/or move the snipe channels to other categories if you wish. You also do not need to keep the 'laniakea bot' category channel.
5. Let me know the channels are setup.
6. That's it. Snipe opportunities should start arriving as they are available.

# What I need to do

* pre-add server to postgress
* wait untill bot is in server
* run node deploy-commands.js
* get user to run setup
* restart sniper with /laniakea restart
